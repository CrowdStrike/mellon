How to connect IMellonFileProviderFactory (which produces IMellonFileProvider
objects) to:
 - a crawler process which contains one or more spiders
 
How to create a CrawlerSpider implementation that can take runtime config
parameters to define unique types (probably using the Python type() call)

How to define and deliver spider settings.  Should try to make this native.
Looks like we could easily allow setting definition in YAML and pass it
into type creation at runtime for spider-specific stuff.  For project level,
not yet sure how API launch would look for it...might be env variable to 
a settings.py file

Figure out how/when to run spiders concurrently vs sequentially (probably
has to do with mellon yaml config and factory definitions in file...

How to define a factory...1-to-1 of spider to factory or many-to-one (prefer the 2nd).
Need way to define spiders where mellon config can deliver all possible 
configs (see CrawlerSpider to understand what options are there)

Might want to be able enable use of base spider types defined by Scrapy with
mellon yaml options.  Also allow create interfaces and base classes to allow
custom spider definitions...hmm..think about this one.


We may want to have Spiders registered via ISpider marker, then have mellon
pick these up via subscriber lookup <--we'd probably run all spiders in a 
single process...might not be the way to go (memory usage?)...we should at
least provide some mechanism to create multiple processes to run spiders.
